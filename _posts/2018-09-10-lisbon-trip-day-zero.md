Our trip to Lisbon came together pretty quickly when I realized that I needed to use my remaining vacation time before the end of the year and had planned nothing. Looking for something that would be mangeable in about five days, with a flight less than 8 hours, we narrowed our choices down to Iceland and Lisbon, both recommended by friends. After a little discussion, D and I chose Lisbon.

I usually spend six months or more reading in preparation for a trip, but with less lead time, I was going into this one with only a couple of small guidebooks and the excellent [Lisbon Lux](https://www.lisbonlux.com/) site under my belt. D is a more spontaneous traveler than I and, as someone who gets to (or has to) travel for work, he is content to leave most of the vacation planning to me. I spent weeks reading and searching posts on TripAdvisor, to the point that I think I managed to confuse myself on a few details, as will be seen later in this trip report. 


## Departure

Our United flight was scheduled for an 8:25 PM departure out of Newark Airport. Red-eyes are not our favorite, but there weren't really any other options we could find for direct flights from NYC to LIS. 

I intended to skip the airline meal and try to go right to sleep, so I had a mediocre fried rice for dinner at the airport while D just had a few dumplings. Once on the plane, I immediately wrapped myself in my shawl, stuck in my earplugs, and pulled my eyemask down. D has a different strategy, so he watched some Netflix shows before falling asleep. Fortunately, we had economy plus seats, which made stretching our legs easier. I drifted off to sleep, looking forward to waking up in a new city.
