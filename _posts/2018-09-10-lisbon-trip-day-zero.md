Sometime in July, my boss asked me when I was going to use my remaining vacation time. I realized I had no trips planned for the rest of the year and felt a sudden need to get out of the country, preferably before the busy fall season at work. 

D and I did some quick thinking about where we might go that would be manageable in five to six days and with a shortish flight. We narrowed our choices down to Iceland and Lisbon, both recommended by friends. Iceland looks amazing—glaciers, waterfalls, geothermal beaches! But it also looked as if it would require us to be more outdoorsy than we really are. Plus, it was the wrong time of year for puffins. Lisbon promised history, architecture, sunshine, and lots of walking in sensible shoes (but no hiking boots or windbreakers required). Lisbon, here we come! 

I usually spend six months or more reading in preparation for a trip, but with less lead time, I was going into this one with only a couple of slim guidebooks and the excellent [Lisbon Lux](https://www.lisbonlux.com/) site under my belt. D, a more spontaneous traveler than I, is content to leave most of the travel planning to me. All he requires is a really nice hotel and enough down time to watch the world go by. I spent weeks reading and searching posts on TripAdvisor—to the point that I think I managed to confuse myself on a few details, as will be seen later in this trip report. 


## Departure

Our United flight was scheduled for an 8:25 PM departure out of Newark Airport. Neither of us likes flying the red-eye, but there weren't really any other options we could find for direct flights from NYC to LIS. 

I intended to skip the airline meal and try to go right to sleep, so I had a mediocre mushroom fried rice for dinner at the airport while D just had a few dumplings. Once on the plane, I buckled my seatbelt, wrapped myself in my shawl, stuck in my earplugs, and pulled down my eyemask. Fortunately, we had economy plus seats, which made stretching our legs easier. I drifted off to an unquiet sleep, looking forward to waking up in a new city.
