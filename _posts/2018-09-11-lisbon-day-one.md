## Arrival

According to my Withings app, I managed to get a little more than four hours of sleep on the plane&#8211;not bad, all things considered, but both D and I were fuzzy-headed getting off the plane. We deplaned on the tarmac via staircase and then boarded a bus to the arrivals area. I don't know if that's the norm for a United flight in Lisbon, or if there was just heavy traffic at the airport that kept us from pulling up to the gate. 

Passport control was very quick, and in about another 20 minutes we had our luggage (we had each checked one bag). Anticipating that we might be groggy (and being spendthrift), we had requested an airport transfer to the hotel. D spotted our driver as soon as we left the baggage claim area. He was a friendly, older gentleman who spoke about as much English as I speak Portuguese. In about 15 minutes or so, we had pulled up to the hotel.

A word about the weather: All throughout my weeks of planning, I had been picturing the city gleaming white in the sun, with brilliant blue skies above. That's what's in all the guidebooks and online photos, after all! And up until a day before we left, that's what my weather app forecast. Instead, Lisbon was gray and damp when we arrived, with a blanket of clouds overhead and clouds in the forecast for most of the week. D and I have a gift for getting unseasonably bad weather on our vacations, so I hoped that if nothing else, the rain would stay away. 

Our hotel was the Eurostars Museum, a new hotel in Alfama, in between the Praça do Comércio and the cruise terminal.

## Walking Tour

Not only does Codecademy have many great courses on various web development languages such as [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css), and [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript), but they even offer a course on [how to deploy a Jekyll site](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/deploy-a-website). If you are completely new to Jekyll, I would recommend working through that course as a great start for learning how to deploy your Jekyll site.

## [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

My personal favourite for learning full stack web development. They offer a great front and back end curriculum that requires you to complete a variety of projects in order to apply the knowledge that you learn during the lessons. As a bonus, at the end of the curriculum you will have a few impressive projects under your belt for your portfolio.

## [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

A great resource not only for learning mathematics (what most people probably know Khan Academy for), but also [computer programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming). What Khan Academy offers that is different from the other two above resources is that it offers courses in [computer science related](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science) topics, such as [algorithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms) and [cryptography](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography). This is unique in that most online resources mostly focus on the programming side of things.
