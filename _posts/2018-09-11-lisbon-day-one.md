## Arrival

My activity tracking app said that I got four hours and twenty minutes of sleep on the plane&#8211;not bad, all things considered. Our plane touched down at 8:20 AM on Tuesday, and we deplaned right on the tarmac down a staircase. Then we all boarded buses to the arrivals terminal. I don't know if that's standard for a United flight in Lisbon or if heavy traffic at the airport prevented us from pulling up to the gate. 

For weeks, I had been picturing a city gleaming white in the sun, brilliant blue skies above&#8211;as it's shown in all the guidebooks and online photos. And until a few days before we left, that was the forecast. Instead, we arrived to a Lisbon shrouded in clouds, with yet more clouds in the forecast for most of the week. D and I have a knack for getting unseasonably bad weather on our vacations, so I tried to stay positive and hoped that at least the rain would stay away. 

We were through passport control and baggage claim in half an hour. Figuring that we might be groggy after the red-eye, I had requested a transfer to the hotel. D spotted our driver, a gregarious older gentleman who spoke about as much English as I speak Portuguese. After a short drive, having passed by a Staples (I had no idea they were international), a few car dealerships, a supermarket, and shipping containers, we pulled up to our hotel, the [Eurostars Museum](https://www.eurostarshotels.co.uk/eurostars-museum.html) on Rua Cais de Santar√©m. 

I had asked for an early check-in; happily, the hotel had a room ready for us, and it was front-facing as requested. Our room featured a large wall map of Vasco de Gama's 1498 route to Calicut and full-length windows with a view of the Tagus river&#8211;as well as the huge *Neue Mein Schiff 1* in port. The proximity of the cruise terminal made me wonder if we'd find hordes of passengers tramping past our doorstep every day, but they must have taken a different path into the city, because it was relatively quiet on our block. We ended up loving the location and actually felt a little removed from the hurly-burly of the most crowded tourist areas. 

Eager to begin our own discovery, we quickly unpacked, showered, and changed into fresh clothes. We took a moment to admire the archaeological exhibit of a Roman floor mosaic in the lobby of the hotel and then set out for a day of walking. 

But first, food. It was now 11:00, and we needed sustenance and weren't feeling too picky about where to find it. Turning right as we left our hotel, we passed through the Arco de Jesus. This is one of the gates through which one can enter Alfama, and it's hard to describe how magical it felt. During our visit, as we continued to learn about the defensive walls that had surrounded Lisboa and learned to look for the explanatory plaques that mark the wall's boundaries, the gates and the narrower postigos never failed to summon a feeling of wonder, a sense that I was slipping into another world.

## Walking Tour

Not only does Codecademy have many great courses on various web development languages such as [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css), and [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript), but they even offer a course on [how to deploy a Jekyll site](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/deploy-a-website). If you are completely new to Jekyll, I would recommend working through that course as a great start for learning how to deploy your Jekyll site.

## [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

My personal favourite for learning full stack web development. They offer a great front and back end curriculum that requires you to complete a variety of projects in order to apply the knowledge that you learn during the lessons. As a bonus, at the end of the curriculum you will have a few impressive projects under your belt for your portfolio.

## [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)

A great resource not only for learning mathematics (what most people probably know Khan Academy for), but also [computer programming](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming). What Khan Academy offers that is different from the other two above resources is that it offers courses in [computer science related](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science) topics, such as [algorithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms) and [cryptography](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography). This is unique in that most online resources mostly focus on the programming side of things.
